🌍 Environmental Monitoring & Collision Control – AIC-DE Internship Project
This repository contains the first phase of my internship project under AIC-DE, focused on environmental monitoring and collision control. The goal is to build a web-based system that processes real-world data to visualize pollution levels, detect anomalies, and support smarter decision-making for sustainability and safety.
📌 Project Overview
This phase involves:
- Sourcing a relevant dataset from Kaggle
- Cleaning and transforming the data
- Uploading the processed dataset to GitHub
- Preparing the foundation for a full-stack web application using JavaScript technologies

  
📁 Dataset Details
- Source: Kaggle
- Topic: Air pollution, vehicle collisions, or environmental sensor data
- Format: CSV
- Preprocessing:
- Removed null values
- Renamed columns for clarity
- Filtered irrelevant rows
- Converted to JSON for frontend compatibility (optional)


🛠️ Tech Stack (Planned)
- Frontend: React.js (for dashboard and data visualization)
- Backend: Node.js + Express (for API and data handling)
- Database: MongoDB (for storing processed data)
- Visualization: Chart.js, Leaflet, or D3.js
📊 Features (Upcoming)
- Pollution heatmaps and trend graphs
- Collision hotspot detection
- Real-time alerts for threshold breaches
- Interactive dashboard for stakeholders
